About Me
====

Hi. I am Ishat, a CS masters student at [the University of Maryland College Park](https://www.cs.umd.edu/) (UMD) working with Dr. Pratap Tokekar. I conduct research on multi-robot systems with a focus on developing learning-based path planners and ensuring resilience of robot teams performing optimization tasks. Before joining UMD, I spent 5 years at [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology](https://cse.buet.ac.bd/) (BUET) as a faculty member and IT consultant. During my time at BUET, I also performed research on efficient processing of visibility queries on spatial databases. 

I have 9+ years of research, development, and teaching experience, which has molded me into a versatile CS practitioner. My academic explorations span diverse fields of computer science including deep learning, robotics, graph algorithms, geometric computing, etc. In my body of research, I have developed and applied techniques from graph theory (e.g., partitioning, maximum flow, matching, etc.) and computational geometry (e.g., triangulation, projective transforms, visible-surface determination) on moderate to large-sized datasets. I also have significant experience with deep learning architectures for single and multi-agent path planning and perception, which include graph neural networks, transformers, value iteration networks, objection detectors, depth estimators, etc.

I have interests in poetry, cricket, and puzzles. I love working with people, both as a mentor and mentee. I will be graduating from UMD in June 2024, and I am excitedly looking forward to starting the next phase of my life as a software engineer.

			<b>Deep Mapping and Path Planning</b><br>
			A memory-enabled deep neural architecture is proposed for multi-robot navigation in a structured environment. The architecture uses value iteration networks to solve the path planning task, and graph neural networks to facilitate inter-robot communication by exchanging environment embeddings. Our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art in both simple and complex occupancy maps, resulting in 5% and 30% increase in action selection accuracy respectively.

			<b>Fast Connectivity Restoration</b><br>
			The Fast Biconnectivity Restoration (FCR) problem involves relocating a team of robots such that their underlying newtork becomes <i>k</i>-connected and the maximum robot movement is minimized. I have developed a Quadratically Constrained Program (QCP) formulation to optimally solve the FCR problem, and also a scalable heuristic graph-theoretic algorithm which gives lower running time. Experiments show that our proposed solution outperforms all existing algorithms. [<a href="https://ieranik.github.io/projects/fcr/">Project Page</a>]

			<b>Resilient Multi-Robot Task Optimization</b><br>
			Resilient Task Optimization for multi-robot systems involves selecting trajectories for each robot such the task performance is maximized in the case of an worst case failure of at most Î± robots. I have developed two algorithms for the resilient coverage maximization task based on greedy heuristic, and local search technique, which gives higher task performance compared to existing approaches. The proposed solution is also tested using a persistent monitoring case study. [<a href="https://ieranik.github.io/projects/rmrto/">Project Page</a>]
