			<b>Deep Mapping and Path Planning</b><br>
			A memory-enabled deep neural architecture is proposed for multi-robot navigation in a structured environment. The architecture uses value iteration networks to solve the path planning task, and graph neural networks to facilitate inter-robot communication by exchanging environment embeddings. Our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art in both simple and complex occupancy maps, resulting in 5% and 30% increase in action selection accuracy respectively.

			<b>Fast Connectivity Restoration</b><br>
			The Fast Biconnectivity Restoration (FCR) problem involves relocating a team of robots such that their underlying newtork becomes <i>k</i>-connected and the maximum robot movement is minimized. I have developed a Quadratically Constrained Program (QCP) formulation to optimally solve the FCR problem, and also a scalable heuristic graph-theoretic algorithm which gives lower running time. Experiments show that our proposed solution outperforms all existing algorithms. [<a href="https://ieranik.github.io/projects/fcr/">Project Page</a>]

			<b>Resilient Multi-Robot Task Optimization</b><br>
			Resilient Task Optimization for multi-robot systems involves selecting trajectories for each robot such the task performance is maximized in the case of an worst case failure of at most Î± robots. I have developed two algorithms for the resilient coverage maximization task based on greedy heuristic, and local search technique, which gives higher task performance compared to existing approaches. The proposed solution is also tested using a persistent monitoring case study. [<a href="https://ieranik.github.io/projects/rmrto/">Project Page</a>]

			<b>Visibility Queries in Spatial Databases</b><br>
			I studied visibility problems which address queries like <i>where to place security cameras to ensure better surveillance of a building complex? </i> or <i>where to place billboards in the city to maximize visibility from the surrounding space?</i>, in the presence of city-scale large set of obstacles indexed in a spatial data structure. I used tools from computational geometry, graph theory, and spatial databases to efficiently answer these qeuries. [<a href="https://ieranik.github.io/projects/vqsd/">Project Page</a>]
