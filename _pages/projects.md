			<b>Deep Mapping and Path Planning</b><br>
			I propose a memory-enabled deep neural architecture for multi-robot navigation in a structured environment. The proposed architecture uses value iteration networks to solve the path planning task, and graph neural networks to facilitate inter-robot communication. Our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art in both simple and complex occupancy maps, resulting in 5% and 30% increase in action selection accuracy respectively.

			<b>Fast Connectivity Restoration</b><br>
			The Fast Biconnectivity Restoration (FCR) problem involves relocating a team of robots such that their underlying newtork becomes <i>k</i>-connected and the maximum robot movement is minimized. I have developed a Quadratically Constrained Program (QCP) formulation to optimally solve the FCR problem, and also a scalable heuristic graph-theoretic algorithm. Experiments show that our proposed solution outperforms all existing algorithms. [<a href="https://ieranik.github.io/projects/fcr/">Project Page</a>]

			<b>Resilient Multi-Robot Task Optimization</b><br>
			Resilient Task Optimization for multi-robot systems involves selecting trajectories for each robot such the task performance is maximized in the case of an worst case failure of at most Î± robots. I have developed two algorithms for the resilient coverage maximization task based on greedy heuristic, and local search technique, which gives higher task performance compared to existing approaches. I have also tested my proposed solution using a persistent monitoring case study. [<a href="https://ieranik.github.io/projects/rmrto/">Project Page</a>]
